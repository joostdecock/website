Freesewing is an open source platform for made-to-measure sewing patterns.

What that means is that if you are here for sewing patterns, you came to the right place.
However, this isn't your average sewing pattern site or company. 
There's a few important differces, specifically:

## Freesewing is an open source project run by a community, not a company

Freesewing is an open source project. 
All of our patterns, but also our platform and even this website are freely 
[available on GitHub](https://github.com/freesewing).

There is no company behind, or linked to, freesewing. 
This is possible due to the hard work of our contributors, and the financial support of our patrons.

## We provide made-to-measure sewing patterns

All of our sewing patterns are made-to-measure. Which means that before you can download a pattern,
you have to give us those measurements. For this, you create **a model**.
It's a list of measurements for the person you're making your garment for (could be yourself, could be someone else).

We use the measurements of your model, and combine them with one of our patterns to create **a draft**.

This draft is what you'll end up downloading. 

## Freesewing is a platform

A platform is something on which you build things, and that's what we'd like to see.

You might be here for our patterns, but we also provid the tools and documentation for 
designers to add their own patterns.

Since our patterns are implemented in code, they require both coding and pattern design skills.
Such diverse skillsets are not often found in the same person, which is why we recommend
collaboration between a developer and a pattern designer.

Stop by [our chatroom on Gitter](https://gitter.im/freesewing/freesewing) to find like-minded 
people you can team up with to add some great new patterns to our growing library.

It's also the best place to turn to should you have further questions.
